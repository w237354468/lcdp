> A convenient Lcdp platform which could help you generate controllers(Spring) by setting on the website instead of
> writing code in IDE. (Maybe can help you save above 30% develop time.)

# Data Model

> Abstract data table which combines several physical tables. When CURD operations execute on abstract table, which
> means operations actually execute on several physical tables.
